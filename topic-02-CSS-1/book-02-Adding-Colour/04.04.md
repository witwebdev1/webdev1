# Worked Example
Before we proceed, we will add some style to an existing <a href="archives/Class Htmls/class1.htm" target = "_blank">web page</a>.

We will add a style element for the body such that the text is blue and the background colour is lightyellow.
~~~
body {
   color: #0000FF;
   background-color:#FFFFE0;
}
~~~

Now, see how the <a href="archives/Class Htmls/class1a.htm"  target = "_blank">web page</a> has improved.

**Note:** As in the examples shown already, to change the background colour of an element use the **background-color** property, to change the font colour of an element use the **color** property.
