#RGB Value

RGB colour values can be specified using this formula: rgb(red, green, blue).

Each parameter (red, green, blue) defines the intensity of the colour between 0 and 255.

For example, rgb(255,0,0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.

So, rgb(0,255,0) is displayed as green, while rgb(0,0,255) is displayed as blue.

Shades of grey are often defined using equal values for all the 3 light sources:

- rgb(0,0,0) is black, 
- rgb(105,105,105) is dimgray,
- rgb(128,128,128) is gray,
- rgb(211,211,211) is lightgray,
- rgb(255, 255, 255) is white.
