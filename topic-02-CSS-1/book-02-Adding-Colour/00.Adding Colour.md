#Objectives

This lab will introduce you to the methods of adding colour.

Colors in CSS are most often specified by:

- a valid [colour name](#01) - like "red";
- an [RGB value](#02) - like "rgb(255, 0, 0)";
- a [HEX value](#03) - like "#ff0000".

This lab also provides you with a [Worked Example](#04).
