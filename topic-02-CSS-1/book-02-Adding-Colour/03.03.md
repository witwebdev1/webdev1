#Hex Value

RGB values can also be specified using hexadecimal colour values in the form: #RRGGBB, where RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) 
are hexadecimal values between 00 and FF (same as decimal 0-255). **Hexadecimal** is a **base-16** number system. We are generally used to the **decimal** number system (**base-10**, from 0 to 9), but hexadecimal has 16 digits, 
from 0 to F. 

The hex number is prefixed with a hash character (**#**) and can be three or six digits in length. Basically, the three-digit version is a compressed version of the six-digit (#f00 becomes #ff0000, #c96 becomes #cc9966 etc.). The three-digit version is easier to decipher (the first digit, like the first value in rgb, is red, the second green and the third blue) but the six-digit version gives you more control over the exact colour.</p>
Colours can be set using RGB colour codes (hex or decimal) or by using the colour names.

For example, #FF0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (FF) and the others are set to the lowest value (00).

So, #00FF00 is displayed as green, while #0000FF is displayed as blue.

Again, shades of grey are often defined using equal values for all the 3 light sources:

- \#000000 or \#000 is black, 
- \#696969 is dimgray,
- \#808080 is gray,
- \#D3D3D3 is lightgray,
- \#FFFFFF or \#FFF is white.

**Note:** HEX values are case-insensitive: "#ff0000" is the same as "FF0000".
