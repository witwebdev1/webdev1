# Grouping Styles
If you want to apply the same style to different elements on a web page, you don't have to repeat
yourself. Here is an example.
~~~
h1, h2, h3 {
   font-family: "Trebuchet MS", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
   background-color: navy;
   color: white;
}
~~~
Translation: if the element is a level one heading, a level two heading, or a level three heading,
set the text to white, the background colour to navy, and the font to Trebuchet MS, or Helvetica, or Arial, or
sans-serif if nothing else is available.

Now, not only do you have the convenience of being able to style many pages from one central location
(your CSS file), but you have the added convenience of being able to style many elements in
one go.
