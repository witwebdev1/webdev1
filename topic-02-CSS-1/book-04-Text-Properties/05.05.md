# The HR Tag 

To add style to a Horizontal Rule (HR), we style a HR rule.

## What properties can you use?
width: [ pixel or percentage value ] specifies the width of the element  
height: [ pixel value ] specifies the line height of the element  
border-width: [ pixel value ] in this case it should be set to zero  
color: [ hex value ] this describes the color of text within an element  
background-color: [ hex value ] sets the background color for the current element  
text-align: [ ] and margin: [ ] details how the element will be horizontally aligned. For cross browser support we use text-align and margin.

**Note:**For cross-bowser syntax, you'll need to include both the color and background-color attributes in the
style sheet. Browsers that understand both,
will draw a border around the element so it is important to use the height attribute to control this.

**Example**

~~~
hr {
   width: 50%;
   height: 6px;
   border-width: 0px;
   color: #9E9E9E;
   background-color: #9E9E9E;
}
~~~
will produce:
<hr style="border-width: 0px;
background-color: #9E9E9E;
color: #9E9E9E;
height: 12px;
width: 50%;
">
