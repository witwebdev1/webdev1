# Font styles

The font-style property sets the style of a font.
~~~
font-style: normal|italic|oblique
~~~

Italic forms are generally cursive in nature while oblique faces are typically sloped versions of the regular face. However, if the font being used does not have italic or oblique faces available, in most cases there is little, if any, difference between italic and oblique.

See the **font-style** property in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/fontstyle.htm" target= "_blank">example</a>.
