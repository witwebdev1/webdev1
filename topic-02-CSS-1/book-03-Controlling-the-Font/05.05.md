# Shorthand properties 

A **shorthand** property in CSS lets you specify multiple properties in one property, for conciseness purposes. 
Instead of specifying each "font-" property separately, you can bundle them up in one "font" property.

blockquote {
       font-weight:bold;
       font-style:italic;
       font-size:120%;
       font-family:Verdana;
}
~~~

The previous four rules can be written as:
~~~
blockquote {
       font: bold italic 120% Verdana;
}
~~~
You need to supply at least font-size and font-family for the shorthand to work, otherwise it'll just be a syntax error and do nothing.
