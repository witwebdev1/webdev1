# Worked Example Continued...

Now, we will add more style to our <a href="archives/Class Htmls/class1a.htm"  target = "_blank">example</a> page. We will modify the selector (body) to include properties such that the font of choice is Verdana. If this font is not available then use any serif font.
~~~
body {
   color: #0000FF;
   background-color:#FFFFE0;
   font-family:Verdana, serif;
}
~~~

Now, see how the <a href="archives/Class Htmls/class1b.htm" target= "_blank">web page</a> has changed.
