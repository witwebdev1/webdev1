# Font weight
The font-weight property sets how thick or thin characters in text should be displayed. The font-weight property sets the weight, or thickness, 
of a font and is dependent either on available font faces within a font family or weights defined by the browser.

font-weight: normal|bold|bolder|lighter|100|200|300|400|500|600|700|800|900

The weight of any font can be altered. The first four options are relative while the numbered values give absolute weights. Most web browsers do not properly support font weights other than normal and bold.  
The keyword value **normal** maps to the numeric value **400** and the value **bold** maps to **700**. In order to see any effect using values other than 400 or 700, the font being used must have built-in faces that match those specified weights.


See the **font-weight** property in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/fontweight.htm" target= "_blank">example</a>.
