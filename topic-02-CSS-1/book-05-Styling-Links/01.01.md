# Styling Links

Links are everywhere on the Web and by default, a browser uses the following colour scheme for links:

<table width = 100%>
<tr>
<th align = left>blue</th><td>an unvisited link</td></tr>
<tr>
<th align = left>purple</th><td>a link to a web page that you've previously visited</td></tr>
<tr>
<th align = left>red</th><td>an active link</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This colour scheme isn't to everyone's taste, but it is what we're stuck with now. At least, it's
what we *would* be stuck with if we couldn't use CSS to redefine those colours.
<p/>
At its most basic, a CSS style for links might look like this:
~~~
a  {
   font-weight:bold;
   color: black
}
~~~
Now, instead of being blue and having a normal font weight, your links appear in bold, black type.
