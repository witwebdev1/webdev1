# Link States

As we have seen previously, there are different types of links (unvisited, visited, active) that you'll
come across on a web page. There's one other state (**hover**), which occurs when you pass your cursor
over the link.  
In CSS, you can change the styling of all of these link states using **pseudo-classes**. The different
states are addressed within the CSS through the use of the *a* element selector, and by applying
(with the aid of a colon) the pseudo-classes of *link, visited, hover*, and *active*.

## Getting your Link States in Order
Links should always be specified in the order shown above: *link, visited, hover*, and *active* as in the example below.

~~~
a:link {
   color: blue;
}

a:visited {
   color: navy;
}

a:hover {
   text-decoration: none;
   color: yellow;
   background-color: navy;
}

a:active {
   color: orange;
   background-color: navy;
}
~~~

See how the links are styled in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/links.htm" target= "_blank">example</a>.
