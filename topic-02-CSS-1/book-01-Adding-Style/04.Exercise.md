# CSS Adding Style Exercise

- Download the following zipped file into Week2 of your Website Development 1 folder: [lab01](archives/lab01.zip).
- Extract/unzip the file (if you right-click on the file, you will usually see an 'extract here' option which is the easiest way to do this! If you're unsure, please ask your tutor.)
- In the lab01 folder, create a sub folder called css.
- Open your text editor and create a blank document. Save the file as *style.css* in the css sub folder.
- In the lab01 folder open **index.html** and add a link tag in the <head> section that links the .css file as follows:
  ~~~
   <link rel="stylesheet" href = "css/style.css">
  ~~~
- Save the file.
- Open **about.html** and **contact.html** and add a link tag (as above) in the <head> section that links the .css file. Save both files.
- Add the following rule to the .css file:
   - body: background colour: hex e2edff;  colour: hex 000080; 
- Save the file, and preview the web pages.
