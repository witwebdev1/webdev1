# Inline Styles
In Word or other similiar packages you will have adding formatting to words, paragraphs etc...The
same effect can be achieved in HTML using a little bit of inline CSS. This is what it looks like:

~~~
<p style="color:red;">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
~~~

In this example, we use a *style* attribute inside the opening &lt;p&gt; tag.

The *style* attribute can contain one or more **declaration** between is quotation marks. A declaration
is made of two parts:


- the *property* (in the example, 'color'), which specifies what aspect of the layout is being set;
- and the *value* ('red'), which gives the value for the style property.

As another example, we will make the sentence appear **boldface**.
~~~
<p style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
~~~
The disadvantage of using *Inline Styles* is that every time you want to style an element such as a paragraph (&lt;p&gt;), you must apply the style
to the necessary element tag.
