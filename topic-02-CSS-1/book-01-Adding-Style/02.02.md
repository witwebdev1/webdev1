# Embedded Styles
An embedded style allows you to add to the start of a web page a section that sets out all the styles that will be used on that page.
To do this, you need to use the *style* element inside the *head*.
~~~
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Bubble Under - The diving club for the south-west UK</title>
  <style>
    p {
       font-weight:bold;
       }
  </style>
</head>
~~~
The embedded style starts with a &lt;style&gt; tag and ends
with a &lt;/style&gt; tag.

As stated previously, to add style we require <em>CSS rules</em>. Each rule has three parts:

1. the <em>selector</em> (in the example: p), which
tells the browser which part of the document is affected by the rule;

2. the <em>property</em>;

3. and the <em>value</em>.

In this case, our style sheet contains one rule: "Please style all the paragraphs on this page so that
the text appears in a bold font."

Another Example:
~~~
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Bubble Under - The diving club for the south-west UK</title>
  <style>
    p {
       font-weight:bold;
       color: blue;
      }
  </style>
</head>
~~~

You can add the attribute ***type = &quot;text/css&quot; *** to the style tag, as in previous versions of HTML.

This method is better than using the previous method(*Inline Styles*) as you can all style elements together (such as all paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;)). However, in a website if you use this method then the style element
must be included in all web pages, which makes maintenace of websites difficult.
